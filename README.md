Beyond Statistics: Unveiling the Best Playing 11 for the 2022 T20 World Cup through Data Analysis

Here is a more detailed overview of the T20 World Cup Data Analysis project, the revised best playing 11:

**1. Overview of the Problem**

The T20 format of cricket is a fast-paced and dynamic game that places a premium on explosive batting, versatile all-rounders, and effective bowling attacks. Selecting the best playing 11 for a T20 World Cup tournament requires a careful consideration of player strengths, role-specific requirements, and team balance. This project aimed to identify the best playing 11 for the 2022 T20 World Cup through a comprehensive data analysis approach.

**2. Data and Modeling Approach**

The project utilized a data-driven approach to identify the best playing 11 for the 2022 T20 World Cup. The process involved the following steps:

**Data Collection:**

- Data on player performance from the 2022 T20 World Cup was collected from the ESPNcricinfo website using web scraping techniques.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

- The collected data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness. This involved handling missing values, identifying outliers, and correcting any inconsistencies in data formats.

**Data Analysis and Player Evaluation:**

- Statistical measures were calculated for each player, including batting average, strike rate, innings batted, balls faced, batting position, bowling economy, bowling strike rate, bowling style, bowling average, and dot ball percentage.
- Players were categorized based on their batting position and bowling style, such as openers, anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist spinners, and specialist fast bowlers.
- Players were evaluated against the defined criteria for each player role. These criteria were established based on the specific requirements and expectations of each role in the T20 format.

**Model Selection:**

- A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was employed to select the best players for each role based on their statistical performance and adherence to the defined criteria. MCDM techniques allow for the consideration of multiple factors and objectives simultaneously.
